ROSIE: Real-time Oversight & Systematic Integrity Evidence

ROSIE is a development framework aligned with GAMP 5, CSA, and 21 CFR Part 11. It mandates that compliance artifacts be co-located with source code, treating the GxP SDLC as a graph-based data problem rather than a document-heavy administrative task.

🚀 The Core Premise

ROSIE directs developers to build applications that are natively validation-ready.

Truth-in-Code: All requirements (URS/FRS) and design specs live in the repo as Markdown.

Dual-Ledger: Intent lives in Git; Approval lives in a System of Record (SoR).

Hard-Gates: Deployment is cryptographically blocked unless the "Integrity Guard" confirms all signatures and hashes are valid.

Self-Validating: The framework proves its own integrity during every CI/CD run.
