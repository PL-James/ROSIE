ROSIE: Real-time Oversight & Systematic Integrity EvidenceThe "Validation-as-Code" Framework for Regulated Software EngineeringStandard MetadataDetailsFramework Version1.0.0PrinciplesGAMP 5 (2nd Ed), CSA (Critical Thinking), 21 CFR Part 11, Annex 11PhilosophyNative Compliance, Dual-Ledger, Self-Validating1. The Basic PremiseROSIE is a development framework that mandates compliance artifacts be co-located with source code. It treats the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a graph-based data problem rather than a document-based administrative problem.1.1 Developer Experience (DevEx)Under ROSIE, developers do not "write validation documents." Instead, they:Define Intent: Author Requirements in Markdown (RFC-001).Tag Design: Annotate implementation logic with @gxp-id (RFC-001).Prove Execution: Bind tests to Requirements via @gxp-traces.Assure Integrity: Commit changes through an "Integrity Guard" (RFC-002).2. Core SDLC Mapping (Code-to-Artifact)ROSIE maps traditional GxP documents to specific code-based artifacts:Traditional DocumentROSIE Code ArtifactMechanismUser Requirements (URS)/specs/*.mdYAML Frontmatter + Markdown ASTDesign Spec (DS)@gxp-id in SourceDocstring/Comment AnnotationsTrace Matrix (RTM)ROSIE GraphAutomatic DAG generation from TagsIQ/OQ/PQ ProtocolsTest Suites@gxp-type tags in Test FrameworksValidation Reportgxp-execution.jsonAggregated evidence from RFC-0033. The Dual-Ledger LogicROSIE operates on the principle that Intent lives in Git, but Approval lives in a System of Record (SoR).Repo Ledger: Contains the "What" and the "How."SoR Ledger: Contains the "Who," the "Signature," and the "Audit Evidence."The Handshake: A cryptographic Manifest Hash (RFC-002) ensures the SoR only approves a specific, immutable state of the Repo.4. Validation Models4.1 Point-in-Time (Milestone) ValidationFor traditional waterfall-style releases, ROSIE allows for a "Validation Freeze."The Engine scans a specific Git Tag.The SoR generates a static RTM and Summary Report.Electronic signatures are collected on the frozen artifact bundle.4.2 Continuous Validation (Streaming)For modern CI/CD, ROSIE enables a "Living State" of validation.Per-PR Validation: Every Pull Request triggers a "Delta Trace."The Hard-Gate: Merging is blocked unless the AI Agent verifies semantic consistency and the SoR confirms all linked requirements are pre-approved.Release Readiness Token (RRT): An automated, time-bound credential that allows the software to execute in a production environment.5. CSA & GAMP 5 AlignmentGAMP 5 (V-Model): ROSIE provides the vertical and horizontal links of the V-model in real-time.CSA (Computer Software Assurance): ROSIE focuses on Critical Thinking by using AI Agents (RFC-002) to identify high-risk changes, allowing humans to focus on signing off on risky logic rather than formatting tables.6. The "Watchdog" (Self-Validation)As defined in RFC-005, the framework is self-validating. The tool that generates the compliance evidence must prove its own integrity (via recursive self-tests) during every execution, ensuring the "Evidence" has not been tampered with or corrupted by the tool itself.The ROSIE Ecosystem (The RFC Stack)RFC-001: Data Standard (Tagging & Manifests)RFC-002: Engine Spec (Hard-Gates & AI Protocols)RFC-003: Evidence Standard (Artifact Packaging)RFC-004: API Interface (The SoR Connector)RFC-005: TQ Baseline (Self-Validation & Archetypes)
