title: Regulatory Mapping Guide
description: Translating traditional GxP compliance milestones into the ROSIE framework
---

**Version:** 1.1.0

This guide translates traditional GxP compliance milestones into the ROSIE framework components. It is designed for QA, Regulatory Affairs, and auditors to understand how digital evidence replaces paper artifacts.

---

## Understanding ROSIE's Boundary

ROSIE is a **specification**, not a complete system. It defines:

- How to structure compliance artifacts in code repositories
- How to compute integrity hashes
- The API contract for approval systems

Your organization's **System of Record (SoR)** handles:

- User authentication and authorization
- Approval workflows and electronic signatures
- Audit trail storage and retention

Any QMS, PLM, or custom system that implements the ROSIE API ([RFC-004](/specs/rfc-004/)) can serve as the SoR.

## 1. Traditional vs. ROSIE Mapping

| Traditional GxP Deliverable      | ROSIE Digital Equivalent      | Why This is Better for Compliance                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User Requirements (URS)          | `specs/urs/*.md`              | Living specs: requirements are version-controlled alongside code |
| Functional/Design Specs (FRS/DS) | `specs/ds/*.md` and `@gxp-id` | Direct links: the design is part of the code                     |
| Traceability Matrix (RTM)        | ROSIE graph (auto-generated)  | Real-time accuracy: derived from code, no manual drift           |
| Test Protocols (IQ/OQ/PQ)        | `tests/` with `@gxp-type`     | Automated execution: tests run on every change                   |
| Validation Summary Report        | `gxp-execution.json`          | Immutable evidence: logs, hashes, and screenshots                |
| Handwritten signatures           | SoR e-signatures              | Part 11 compliant: signatures are linked to a specific Git hash  |

## 2. Navigating the Audit Trail

In a traditional audit, you look at a binder. In a ROSIE-enabled audit, you look at the Dual-Ledger.

### 1. Prove the Intent (the repo)

**Auditor question:** "Where did you say the system would do X?"

**Answer:** The Markdown file in `/specs`. Git history shows who wrote it and when.

### 2. Prove the Design (the code)

**Auditor question:** "How did you implement that requirement?"

**Answer:** The ROSIE Engine follows the `@gxp-id` tag to the exact function in code.

### 3. Prove the Verification (the evidence)

**Auditor question:** "How do I know this actually works?"

**Answer:** The `gxp-execution.json` shows test results, evidence attachments, and the RRT.

## 3. Hard-Gate vs. Traditional "Go-Live"

| Traditional "Go-Live"                                    | ROSIE Hard-Gate                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human check: a person verifies signed documents          | Digital check: deployment is blocked if any signature or hash is missing         |
| Point-in-time: validation is a snapshot from last month  | Continuous: validation is a live status of the current build                     |
| High friction: releases wait on paperwork routing        | Low friction: releases proceed because evidence is generated during development  |

## 4. Addressing GAMP 5 and CSA Principles

- **Critical thinking (CSA)**: The AI agent flags high-risk changes (e.g., security, data integrity), so QA focuses on the most important areas
- **Fitness for purpose**: Self-validation proves the tool works correctly on every run, not just during a one-time validation

---

## 5. Summary for Auditors

ROSIE supports 21 CFR Part 11 compliance by ensuring:

- **Integrity**: The manifest hash prevents undetected changes to validated code
- **Traceability**: Every requirement is digitally linked to code and tests
- **Accountability**: Every approval is a timestamped, cryptographically secure e-signature
