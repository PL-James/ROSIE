| Framework Version | 1.0.0                                                              |
| Principles        | GAMP 5 (2nd Ed), CSA (Critical Thinking), 21 CFR Part 11, Annex 11 |
| Philosophy        | Native Compliance, Dual-Ledger, Self-Validating                    |

## 1. Basic Premise

ROSIE mandates that compliance artifacts be co-located with source code. It treats the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a graph-based data problem rather than a document-based administrative problem.

### 1.1 Developer Experience (DevEx)

Under ROSIE, developers do not "write validation documents." Instead, they:

- **Define intent**: Author requirements in Markdown ([RFC-001](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-001/))
- **Tag design**: Annotate implementation logic with `@gxp-id` ([RFC-001](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-001/))
- **Prove execution**: Bind tests to requirements via `@gxp-traces`
- **Assure integrity**: Commit changes through the Integrity Guard ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/))

---

## 2. Core SDLC Mapping (Code-to-Artifact)

ROSIE maps traditional GxP documents to specific code-based artifacts:

| Traditional Document    | ROSIE Code Artifact  | Mechanism                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| User Requirements (URS) | `/specs/*.md`        | YAML front matter + Markdown AST    |
| Design Spec (DS)        | `@gxp-id` in source  | Docstring or comment annotations    |
| Trace Matrix (RTM)      | ROSIE graph          | Automatic DAG generation from tags  |
| IQ/OQ/PQ protocols      | Test suites          | `@gxp-type` tags in test frameworks |
| Validation report       | `gxp-execution.json` | Aggregated evidence from [RFC-003](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-003/) |

---

## 3. Dual-Ledger Logic

ROSIE operates on the principle that intent lives in Git, but approval lives in a System of Record (SoR).

- **Repo ledger**: Contains the "what" and the "how"
- **SoR ledger**: Contains the "who," the signature, and the audit evidence
- **Handshake**: A cryptographic manifest hash ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/)) ensures the SoR only approves a specific, immutable repo state

---

## 4. Validation Models

### 4.1 Point-in-Time (Milestone) Validation

For traditional waterfall-style releases, ROSIE allows a validation freeze:

- The engine scans a specific Git tag
- The SoR generates a static RTM and summary report
- Electronic signatures are collected on the frozen artifact bundle

### 4.2 Continuous Validation (Streaming)

For modern CI/CD, ROSIE enables a living validation state:

- **Per-PR validation**: Every pull request triggers a delta trace
- **Hard-Gate**: Merging is blocked unless the AI agent verifies semantic consistency and the SoR confirms all linked requirements are pre-approved
- **Release Readiness Token (RRT)**: A time-bound credential that allows software to execute in a production environment

---

## 5. CSA and GAMP 5 Alignment

- **GAMP 5 (V-model)**: ROSIE provides the vertical and horizontal links of the V-model in real time
- **CSA (Computer Software Assurance)**: ROSIE uses AI agents ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/)) to highlight high-risk changes, allowing humans to focus on approvals for critical logic

---

## 6. The "Watchdog" (Self-Validation)

As defined in [RFC-005](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-005/), the framework is self-validating. The tool that generates compliance evidence must prove its own integrity (via recursive self-tests) during every execution, ensuring the evidence has not been tampered with or corrupted by the tool itself.
