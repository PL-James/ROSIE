| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Framework Version | 1.1.0                                                              |

| Scope             | Connected environments (air-gapped deployments out of scope)       |

## 1. Basic Premise

ROSIE mandates that compliance artifacts be co-located with source code. It treats the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a graph-based data problem rather than a document-based administrative problem.

### 1.1 Developer Experience (DevEx)

Under ROSIE, developers do not "write validation documents." Instead, they:

- **Define intent**: Author requirements in Markdown ([RFC-001](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-001/))
- **Tag design**: Annotate implementation logic with `@gxp-id` ([RFC-001](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-001/))
- **Prove execution**: Bind tests to requirements via `@gxp-traces`
- **Assure integrity**: Commit changes through the Integrity Guard ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/))

---

## 2. Core SDLC Mapping (Code-to-Artifact)

ROSIE maps traditional GxP documents to specific code-based artifacts:

| Traditional Document    | ROSIE Code Artifact  | Mechanism                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| User Requirements (URS) | `/specs/*.md`        | YAML front matter + Markdown AST    |
| Design Spec (DS)        | `@gxp-id` in source  | Docstring or comment annotations    |
| Trace Matrix (RTM)      | ROSIE graph          | Automatic DAG generation from tags  |
| IQ/OQ/PQ protocols      | Test suites          | `@gxp-type` tags in test frameworks |
| Validation report       | `gxp-execution.json` | Aggregated evidence from [RFC-003](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-003/) |

## 3. Dual-Ledger Logic

ROSIE operates on the principle that intent lives in Git, but approval lives in a System of Record (SoR).

- **Repo ledger**: Contains the "what" and the "how"
- **SoR ledger**: Contains the "who," the signature, and the audit evidence
- **Handshake**: A cryptographic manifest hash ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/)) ensures the SoR only approves a specific, immutable repo state

### 3.1 ROSIE Boundary (What's In Scope)

ROSIE defines:

- **Data formats**: How to tag code and structure requirements ([RFC-001](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-001/))
- **Hash computation**: How to generate deterministic integrity fingerprints ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/))
- **Evidence schema**: How to package test execution artifacts ([RFC-003](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-003/))
- **API contract**: The interface any SoR must implement ([RFC-004](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-004/))
- **Qualification protocol**: How to validate a ROSIE-compliant engine ([RFC-005](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-005/))

### 3.2 SoR Responsibility (What's Out of Scope)

The System of Record is responsible for:

- **User authentication and authorization**: Who can approve what
- **Approval workflows**: Sequential, parallel, role-based, or custom
- **Electronic signatures**: 21 CFR Part 11 compliant signature capture
- **Audit trail storage**: Immutable record retention
- **Notification and escalation**: Alerting stakeholders

Any system that implements [RFC-004](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-004/)'s API contract can serve as the SoR: commercial QMS platforms, PLM systems, or custom-built approval applications.

### 3.3 Out of Scope

- **Air-gapped environments**: ROSIE assumes network connectivity between CI/CD and SoR
- **Offline approval workflows**: All approvals must be recorded in the SoR before release gates pass

---

## 4. Validation Models

### 4.1 Point-in-Time (Milestone) Validation

For traditional waterfall-style releases, ROSIE allows a validation freeze:

- The engine scans a specific Git tag
- The SoR generates a static RTM and summary report
- Electronic signatures are collected on the frozen artifact bundle

### 4.2 Continuous Validation (Streaming)

For modern CI/CD, ROSIE enables a living validation state:

- **Per-PR validation**: Every pull request triggers a delta trace
- **Hard-Gate**: Merging is blocked unless the AI agent verifies semantic consistency and the SoR confirms all linked requirements are pre-approved
- **Release Readiness Token (RRT)**: A time-bound credential that allows software to execute in a production environment

---

## 5. CSA and GAMP 5 Alignment

- **GAMP 5 (V-model)**: ROSIE provides the vertical and horizontal links of the V-model in real time
- **CSA (Computer Software Assurance)**: ROSIE uses AI agents ([RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/)) to highlight high-risk changes, allowing humans to focus on approvals for critical logic

---

## 6. Multi-Repository Products

Many GxP products span multiple repositories. ROSIE supports this through product composition.

### 6.1 Product Manifest Linking

The root product declares dependencies in `gxp-product.md`:

```yaml
product_name: "LabData-Platform"
product_code: "LDP"
composition:
  - repo: "github.com/org/labdata-core"
    product_code: "LDC"
    version: "2.1.0"
    rrt_required: true
  - repo: "github.com/org/labdata-auth"
    product_code: "LDA"
    version_constraint: "^1.5.0"
    rrt_required: true
```

### 6.2 Aggregated Traceability

When validating a composed product:

1. Each sub-repository must have a valid Release Readiness Token (RRT)
2. The root product's trace graph includes edges to sub-repository nodes
3. The manifest hash incorporates sub-repository hashes

### 6.3 Cross-Repository Tracing

Requirements can trace across repository boundaries:

```python
# @gxp-id: LDP-DS-001
# @gxp-traces: LDC-FRS-101, LDA-URS-005
```

---

## 7. The "Watchdog" (Self-Validation)

As defined in [RFC-005](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-005/), the framework is self-validating. The tool that generates compliance evidence must prove its own integrity (via recursive self-tests) during every execution, ensuring the evidence has not been tampered with or corrupted by the tool itself.
