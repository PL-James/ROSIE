## 1. Scope

This RFC provides the standard protocol and reference data required to qualify a ROSIE Engine. It also defines product archetypes, ensuring the ROSIE process adapts its validation rigor to the nature of the software product.

---

## 2. The Golden Repository (Reference Data)

The TQ baseline includes a "Golden Repository" containing:

### 2.1 Valid Patterns

100+ variations of `@gxp-` tags across five languages:

| Language | File Extensions | Comment Styles |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| C# | `.cs` | `//`, `/* */`, `///` |
| Java | `.java` | `//`, `/* */`, `/** */` |
| Python | `.py` | `#`, `"""` |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx` | `//`, `/* */`, `/** */` |
| Go | `.go` | `//`, `/* */` |

### 2.2 Invalid Patterns

Purposely broken scenarios for negative testing:

- Hashes with intentional corruption
- Circular dependencies in trace graphs
- Missing signatures
- Duplicate IDs
- Malformed YAML front matter

---

## 3. Product Archetypes and ASV

Not all GxP products are built equally. The ROSIE Engine must recognize the product archetype declared in the `gxp-product.md` manifest.

### 3.1 Archetype Definitions

| Archetype      | Examples              | Validation Focus                | Evidence Requirements          |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| SaaS/Cloud     | Web apps, portals     | Multi-tenancy, session auth     | PQ screenshots, API logs       |
| Embedded/Edge  | Device firmware, IoT  | Memory safety, hardware interop | Unit test coverage, IQ hashes  |
| Data/AI        | Analytics, ML models  | Data lineage, reproducibility   | Model weights, dataset hashes  |
| Infrastructure | Platform-as-a-service | Security guardrails, networking | Terraform state, config drifts |

### 3.2 ASV Profiles

| Profile | Evidence Level | Review Rigor | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| `minimal` | Logs only | AI review | Low-risk utilities |
| `standard` | Logs + screenshots | AI + spot human review | Most products |
| `rigorous` | Full evidence + video | AI + full human review | High-risk/regulated |

---

## 4. Self-Validating Continuous Validation (SVCV)

To achieve self-validating status, the ROSIE Engine must perform recursive verification of its own integrity during every CI/CD run.

### 4.1 Recursive Integrity Check

| Step | Action | Failure Mode |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Tool self-test**: Run a subset of the Golden Repository against the engine | Pipeline halted |
| 2 | **Engine checksum**: Verify the engine binary/image hash against a known-good hash stored in the SoR | Pipeline halted |
| 3 | **Proceed**: Only if steps 1-2 pass, scan production code | N/A |

### 4.2 Automated Deviation Reporting

- **Auto-log**: Any failure of the Hard-Gate ([RFC-002](/specs/rfc-002/)) must automatically generate a deviation report in the SoR
- **Root cause tagging**: The AI agent identifies which requirements (URS/FRS) are breached by the current code state

## 5. Qualification Protocols

### 5.1 Operational Qualification (OQ)

To pass OQ, a ROSIE Engine must achieve:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Extraction recall | 100% |
| Extraction precision | 100% |
| Gate fidelity | 100% |
| Archetype awareness | 100% |

### 5.2 Performance Qualification (PQ)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Throughput | Process 1,000-file repo in < 60 seconds |
| Persistence | SoR correctly archives evidence package |
| Latency | Continuous tracking of time-to-trace |

---

## 6. Continuous Validation Lifecycle

| Stage  | Action                     | Validation Artifact           |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Commit | Sync and semantic check    | Proposed trace graph          |
| Build  | Engine self-test           | Tool health certificate       |
| Test   | Evidence capture ([RFC-003](/specs/rfc-003/)) | Execution evidence (JSON)     |
| Merge  | Hard-Gate RRT issue        | Automated release certificate |
