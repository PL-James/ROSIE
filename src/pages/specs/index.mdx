description: The ROSIE RFC stack — technical specifications for compliance-as-code
---

The ROSIE framework is defined by five Request for Comments (RFC) documents. Together, they specify the data structures, engine behavior, evidence formats, API contracts, and qualification requirements for a compliant implementation.

---

## RFC Overview

| RFC | Title | Status | Focus |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| [RFC-001](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-001/) | Data Standard | Draft | Tagging syntax, manifest schema |
| [RFC-002](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/) | Engine Spec | Draft | Hard-gates, AI protocols, sync logic |
| [RFC-003](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-003/) | Evidence Standard | Draft | Artifact packaging, 21 CFR Part 11 |
| [RFC-004](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-004/) | API Interface | Draft | SoR connector, REST contracts |
| [RFC-005](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-005/) | TQ Baseline | Draft | Self-validation, product archetypes |

## RFC-001: Data Standard

**"Truth-in-Repo" Schema**

Defines the universal syntax and structure for embedding GxP validation metadata within Git repositories. Covers:

- Repository manifest (`gxp-product.md`)
- Requirement schema in Markdown
- Annotation syntax (`@gxp-id`, `@gxp-traces`, `@gxp-type`)
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation

## RFC-002: Engine Spec

**Integrity Guard and Sync**

Defines the functional requirements for the ROSIE Engine — the automated orchestrator responsible for:

- Dual-ledger synchronization (repo ↔ SoR)
- Manifest hash computation
- Pre-commit enforcement
- AI agent protocols
- Release Readiness Token (RRT) generation

[Read RFC-002 →](/ROSIE/specs/rfc-002/)

---

## RFC-003: Evidence Standard

**Artifact Packaging**

Defines the structure of the `gxp-execution.json` artifact for capturing automated test outputs in a format that satisfies 21 CFR Part 11:

- Evidence package schema
- Environment state capture
- Visual evidence requirements
- Log sanitization rules
- Immutability guarantees

## RFC-004: API Interface

**SoR Connector**

Defines the RESTful API contract that any System of Record must implement to support ROSIE:

- Core endpoints (`/sync/manifest`, `/release/readiness`, `/evidence/upload`)
- Security requirements (mTLS, OAuth2)
- Non-repudiation via signed requests

## RFC-005: TQ Baseline

**Tool Qualification and Product Archetypes**

Provides the standard protocol and reference data required to qualify a ROSIE Engine:

- Golden repository reference data
- Product archetype definitions
- Self-validating continuous validation (SVCV)
- OQ/PQ protocols for the engine itself
