## 1. Scope

This RFC defines the functional requirements for the ROSIE Engine, the automated software orchestrator responsible for extracting RFC-001 data, maintaining Dual-Ledger synchronization with a System of Record (SoR), and enforcing regulatory gates within the CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Sync protocol (Dual-Ledger)

The engine must maintain state consistency between the Git repository (design intent) and the SoR (regulatory approval).

### 2.1 Ingest logic (repo -> SoR)

- Extraction: Scan the repository at every PR or commit to build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of requirements and annotations.
- Diff detection: Identify new, modified, or deleted `@gxp-` blocks and push these proposed changes to the SoR.
- Versioning: Associate every sync event with a unique Git commit SHA.

### 2.2 Reflect logic (SoR -> repo)

- Metadata injection: Pull approval statuses, timestamps, and e-signatures into the YAML front matter of corresponding `.md` files.
- Non-destructive write: Update only designated metadata fields, never altering requirement narrative text or implementation code.

### 2.3 Audit trail requirements

Every transaction performed by the engine must be logged in an immutable audit trail within the SoR, containing:

- `user_id` (or `agent_id` for automated tasks)
- `timestamp` (UTC)
- `action_type` (e.g., `INGEST`, `REFLECT`, `HASH_VERIFY`)
- `payload_hash` (SHA-256 of the exchanged data)

## 3. Data integrity (the Integrity Guard)

### 3.1 The manifest hash

The engine must compute a cumulative SHA-256 hash of the entire validation state.

- Input: Concatenation of all `@gxp-id`, `@gxp-traces`, and the text content of linked requirements.
- Storage: The manifest hash is stored in the SoR as the canonical fingerprint of the validated version.
- Validation: Any change to code or specs during the release cycle results in a hash mismatch, automatically revoking Approved status.

### 3.2 Pre-commit enforcement

To prevent shadow documentation (manual edits to approved metadata), the engine provides a client-side hook:

- Mechanism: Compare local metadata blocks against the last known sync state from the SoR.
- Enforcement: Reject commits if `status: Approved` is found in a modified block without a valid SoR-signed sync token.

## 4. AI agent protocol

The engine uses an AI subsystem to enhance auditability and accelerate legacy retrofitting.

### 4.1 Semantic consistency check

- Logic: Compute vector embeddings for requirement text and the implemented code block.
- Alerting: If cosine similarity falls below a configurable threshold (default: 0.75), flag the trace for manual review.

### 4.2 Shadow mode retrofitting

- Restricted access: AI is forbidden from writing directly to `.md` or source files during initial discovery.
- Proposal file: AI generates `gxp-proposal.json` containing recommended tags and links.
- Acceptance: A human developer must apply the proposal, at which point the engine performs the injection and logs the action as AI-assisted traceability.

## 5. Automated release gates (Hard-Gate)

The engine acts as a blocking gate in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

### 5.1 Gate logic (RRT protocol)

The engine evaluates the following expression before allowing a build to proceed to a regulated environment:

`G = (S_all AND H_match AND T_pass)`

Where:

- `S_all`: All identified IDs in the PR have Approved status in the SoR.
- `H_match`: The current manifest hash matches the SoR-signed hash.
- `T_pass`: All verification nodes (OQ/PQ) associated with the change have passed execution.

### 5.2 Release Readiness Token (RRT)

If `G` is true, the engine generates a short-lived, cryptographically signed RRT. Deployment scripts must verify this token before deploying artifacts.

## 6. Tool qualification (TQ) and GAMP 5 compliance

To be fit for purpose in a GxP environment, the ROSIE Engine must satisfy qualification requirements.

### 6.1 Operational qualification (OQ) for the engine

- Extraction accuracy: Test against a golden repository to ensure 100% accuracy in tag extraction across all supported languages.
- Failure modes: Verify that the engine correctly fails the Hard-Gate when signatures are missing or hashes are tampered with.

### 6.2 AI reliability (the non-deterministic guard)

- Source tagging: Any trace or metadata generated by AI must be explicitly tagged with provenance: `ai-inferred`.
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL): AI-inferred traces cannot satisfy `S_all` until promoted to provenance: `human-verified` by a qualified user.
