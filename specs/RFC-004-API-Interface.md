RFC-004: ROSIE API Interface (The SoR Connector)MetadataDetailsRFC ID004TitleROSIE API Interface: Standard Contract for System of Record InteroperabilityStatusDraftFocusAPI Contracts, REST/gRPC, Authentication, Webhooks1. ScopeThis RFC defines the RESTful API contract that any System of Record (SoR) must implement to support the ROSIE Engine. This prevents vendor lock-in and allows for cross-platform compliance synchronization.2. Core Endpoints2.1 POST /v1/sync/manifestSubmits the extracted repository state to the SoR.Payload: Includes the gxp-product.md data and the list of extracted @gxp- nodes.Behavior: Upserts nodes into the SoR graph and flags "Drift" if requirements have changed.2.2 GET /v1/release/readiness/{sha}Checks if a specific commit is ready for deployment.Returns: JSON object containing is_ready: boolean, pending_signatures: [], and release_token: string (RRT).2.3 POST /v1/evidence/uploadSubmits the gxp-execution.json (defined in RFC-003) to the SoR.Behavior: Links test results to specific @gxp-id nodes in the trace graph.3. Security & AuthAuth (MUST): All requests must use mTLS or OAuth2 (Bearer Token).Non-Repudiation (MUST): Every request must include an X-ROSIE-Signature header, which is a hash of the payload signed by the Engine's private key.Refer to RFC-002 for the Engine sequence diagrams utilizing these endpoints.
