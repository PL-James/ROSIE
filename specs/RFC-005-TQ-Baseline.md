RFC-005: ROSIE TQ Baseline & Self-Validation

1. Self-Validating Continuous Validation (SVCV)

The Engine must prove its own integrity during every run.

Tool-Self-Test: Engine runs a "Golden Repository" check against itself.

Engine Checksum: Verifies its own binary hash against the SoR.

2. Product Archetypes

Adjusts rigor based on product type (SaaS, Embedded, Data/AI, Infrastructure).
