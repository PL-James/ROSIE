RFC-005: ROSIE TQ Baseline & Product Archetype StandardsMetadataDetailsRFC ID005TitleROSIE TQ Baseline: Reference Dataset & Product Archetype StandardsStatusDraftFocusGAMP 5, Tool Validation, Product Archetypes, SVCV1. ScopeThis RFC provides the standard protocol and reference data required to qualify a ROSIE Engine. Additionally, it defines Product Archetypes, ensuring the ROSIE process adapts its validation rigor to the specific nature of the software product (e.g., Microservices, Embedded Systems, or Data Pipelines).2. The Golden Repository (Reference Data)The TQ Baseline includes a "Golden Repository" containing:Valid Patterns: 100+ variations of @gxp- tags across 5 languages (C#, Java, Python, TS, Go).Invalid Patterns: Purposely broken hashes, circular dependencies, and missing signatures.Edge Cases: Non-standard Markdown headers and multi-line comments.3. Product Archetypes & Archetype-Specific Validation (ASV)Not all GxP products are built equally. The ROSIE Engine must recognize the Product Archetype declared in the gxp-product.md manifest and adjust the "Integrity Guard" (RFC-002) accordingly.3.1 Archetype DefinitionsArchetypeExamplesValidation FocusEvidence ReqsSaaS/CloudWeb Apps, PortalsMulti-tenancy, Session AuthPQ Screenshots, API LogsEmbedded/EdgeDevice Firmware, IoTMemory Safety, Hardware InteropUnit Test Coverage, IQ HashesData/AIAnalytics, ML ModelsData Lineage, ReproducibilityModel Weights, Dataset HashesInfrastructurePlatform-as-a-ServiceSecurity Guardrails, NetworkingTerraform State, Config Drifts3.2 Product-Level InheritanceFor products consisting of multiple repositories, the ROSIE Engine must support Validation Inheritance.Shared Libraries: If a "Product" depends on a validated internal library, the ROSIE Engine verifies the dependency's Release Readiness Token (RRT) rather than re-validating the library code.Aggregated RTM: The Engine must be capable of generating a "Master Traceability Matrix" that merges nodes from all sub-component repositories.4. Self-Validating Continuous Validation (SVCV)To achieve "Self-Validating" status, the ROSIE Engine must perform a recursive verification of its own integrity during every CI/CD run.4.1 The Recursive Integrity CheckTool-Self-Test: The Engine runs a subset of the "Golden Repository" (Section 2) against itself before scanning the production code.Engine Checksum: The Engine verifies its own binary/image hash against a "Known Good" hash stored in the SoR.Failure Mode: If the Engine fails its own self-test or hash check, the entire CI/CD pipeline is invalidated.4.2 Automated Deviation ReportingAuto-Log: Any failure of the Hard-Gate (RFC-002) must automatically generate a "Deviation Report" in the SoR.Root Cause Tagging: The AI Agent (RFC-002) shall identify which Requirements (URS/FRS) are breached by the current code state.5. Operational Qualification (OQ) ProtocolTo pass the OQ, a ROSIE Engine must achieve:Extraction Recall: 100% (No tags missed).Extraction Precision: 100% (No false positives).Gate Fidelity: Correct rejection of all "Invalid Pattern" commits.Archetype Awareness: Correct identification and application of ASV rules based on the manifest.6. Performance Qualification (PQ) ProtocolThroughput: Engine must process a 1,000-file repo in < 60 seconds.Persistence: Verification that the SoR correctly archives the Evidence Package.Latency Monitoring: Continuous tracking of the "Time-to-Trace."7.
